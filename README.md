## Retrospective

### Experience

The lack of a planning document resulted in an unstructured development process. In addition, inconsistencies in commit conventions created confusion, such as initially using `feat` and later switching to `chore` for CSS styling changes.

### Next Action

I plan to establish clear structural plans and standardized commit conventions, including component organization, before starting the next project.

## Next Plan

I plan to enhance the project by adding new components at the bottom of the page.
